The need to mine content from the scholarly literature at scale is inhibited by technical and political barriers. Publishers have partially addressed this by providing application programming interfaces (APIs). However, we observe that many publisher APIs come with unrealistic restrictions, and that while only a few publishers provide APIs, almost all publishers make their content available on the web. With current web technologies it should be possible to harvest and mine the entire scholarly literature as it is published, regardless of the source of publication, and without using specialised programmatic interfaces controlled by each publisher. To address this challenge we developed scraperJSON, a standard for defining reusable web scrapers as JSON objects, and Thresher, a modern web-scraping library that serves as the reference implementation of the scraperJSON standard. We will demonstrate the use of Thresher for scraping the scholarly literature using our community maintained collection of scraperJSON scrapers targetting many major publishers.
