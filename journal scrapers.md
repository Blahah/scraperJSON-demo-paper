## Journal scrapers

We developed a collection of scraperJSON scrapers for major publishers (https://github.com/ContentMine/journal-scrapers). The scrapers collect article metadata, all downloadable resources associated with the article, as well as citations and the full text of the article if available. Maintenance and expansion of the collection is done with the help of a fast-growing community of volunteers. Each scraper is associated with a list of URLs for which the expected scraping results are known, and an automated testing system (using Github and Travis CI integration) checks that all the scrapers are functioning every day and after every change to a scraper. This allows rapid response to formatting changes by publishers. Accessory scripts are provided for automatically generating tests for scrapers, and for running the tests. The whole collection is released under the CC0 license.
